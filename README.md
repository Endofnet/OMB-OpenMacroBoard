# OMB-OpenMacroBoard

These are the PCB-Files for the OpenMacroBoard (O.M.B.) the O.M.B. is a 10-key, programmable keyboard.
It is meant to be used with the [OMB-OpenMacroBoard](https://github.com/Endofnet/OMB-OpenMacroBoard-Firmware "OMB-Firmware on GitHub").<br/>
As the board uses an Atmega32u4 it should be possible to use it with QMK if ported, but that is currently not implemented.
The first released version of the O.M.B. is version 1.1.
